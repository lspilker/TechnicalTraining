## Tasks

### Task 1

Currently only the name and the current number of votes are displayed in the Proposal object. In order to create more transparency, the Ethereum address of the creator should also be added. Implement this requirement in the existing contract.

### Task 2

An attacker is trying to manipulate the election and has stolen a private key to gain access to another Ethereum address. The voter knows the compromised address and wants to exclude it from the vote. Empower the creator of the contract to deny certain addresses the right to participate in the vote.

### Task 3

Not everyone wants to take part in the vote themselves, but they do not want to waste their vote. Add the possibility to give other Ethereum addresses the right to vote for one's own person.
